= MavenLogger

Easily logger for mongoid

== Usage

MavenLogger requires you to have a LoggerEntry and LoggerSchema models.
The simplest way is to use the generator for install maven_logger:

  rails generate maven_logger:install

Next step is to determine in config maven_logger.rb file what generates an event in your various classes.

  MavenLogger.setup do |config|
    config.class_actions = [
      [PostsController, %i[new create]],
      [Post, %i[import]],
      ...
    ]
  end

and add description text to maven_logger.en.yml that should be written in description in LoggerEntry
Name of locale method should contain name of class with underscore. For example:

  maven_logger:
    posts_controller:
      new: 'new post event called'
      create: 'post created'
    post:
      import: 'the new post imported'

You can add schema statements to classes to log some info about it.
For example to save of count results:

  class LoggerSchema < MavenLogger::Schema
    add_schema_for Post, :import, :data_fetched

    private

    def self.data_fetched(result)
      { count: result.count }
    end
  end
